# avalitranslation
Software to translate the avali language. 
This software is made 100% by me, every line- except for maybe a couple dozen- was understood and written at some point. There is like one short function somewhere that was beyond me that I had to outsource. With that being said I am very afraid of someone stealing ownership of it somehow as this is my first large project (taking over 6 months). So the software is licenced under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3). See the licence file.

This project was started in at least 11/23/2024 although it could have been a bit longer than that. Version 1 (Workable inital release) was finsihed as of 7/13/2024. I had  my full attention on college and other matters so my projects had to be put on hold, including the one that was suppost to accompony this one. I have expantions and aditonal content and features I will be adding to this as time goes on but I wanted to get it out sooner than later because due to my perfectionism "later" is basicaly never. 

If you ever experience an issue where you can no longer open the program (instant crash) it is probably the ini file- it should automaticaly restore itself but maybe it broke some new way. Anything like that can be fixed by reinstalling the program for now but please if you can document your bug and how to recreate it, or at least the conditions it occured in and make a bug report through GitHub.

Features:
Font Translation: Using the avali scratch text (Galactic Common) to help you learn- or translate avali text. I will add an inverse of this for ease of use later.
Pronunciation: Subs in how an avali would have to say certain things in speach since they can't pronounce certain letters.
Numbers: Base 12 glyph number system. This was dificult to figure out but you can now put in any base 10 number. i.e 64 and get the avali (base 12) equivilant.
User settings: Mostly a work in progress but you can change your theme for the application.
There is an ini file where you can set up custom themes but unless that intrests you, you wont have to worry about it. There are 2 preset themes accessible through the aplication itself.  

I wont abandon this software and will fix any major bugs asap but I do need to take some time to seperate myself from it and work on other things for a little bit. All credits for the software can be found in the credits window.
